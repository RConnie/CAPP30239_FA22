This repo is being used for a Univeristy of Chiacgo's Data Visualization course (CAPP30239_FA22).  The code is used for class assignments and for use as the owner's portfolio.  This file will be updated as the course progresses.  At this time it is not open to contributions outside of the University.

Lastest update:
