<h1>Description of data</h1>
Each dataset contains information about programming for the top streaming entertainment apps (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Disney Plus, YouTube).  Titles, directors names, genre, runtimes, and ratings are some of the categories provided.


<h1>Why you are interested in this topic </h1>
I'm interested in exploring family (G/E rated) media from these platforms and visualizing the similarities and outliers of these programs.  I'm curious what patterns emerge related to regions, genre, runtimes, diversity of crew, production date, top rated, etc.


<h1>Potential data points</h1>
Some areas of interest: 
* Overall top programs, type, and genre
* Any overlapp between the apps
* Comparing movie/tv shows geared toward all audiences to all other media, ie  are there more diverse cast/crew compared to more mature rated programming?
* Any outliers 

<h1>Any concerns about the data</h1>
I would like to find data based on time when shows are most watched or utilized by the most viewers.  Also want to find any supplimental data on region.

<h1>Identify if source is primary or secondary</h1>
All of my current datasets will be used as a primary source.  I am still on the look out for secondary sources that will address time when these shows are most viewed or time of year where some shows are more popular than other times. 

<h1>If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source?</h1>
