<h2>Description of data</h2>
Each dataset contains information about programming for the top streaming entertainment apps (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Disney Plus, YouTube).  Titles, directors names, genre, runtimes, and ratings are some of the categories provided.


<h2>Why you are interested in this topic </h2>
Media consumed by users under the age of 13 is a massive market and I'm curious what their viewing patterns show, particularly since this generation alpha (birth year 2010-present) is completely  immersed in on demand platforms.  I'm interested in exploring family media (media designated for all/general audiences) from these platforms and visualizing the similarities and outliers of these programs.  I'm curious what patterns emerge related to regions, genre, runtimes, diversity of crew, production date, top rated, etc.  Movies, TV shows, and YouTube channels with matutriy rating of G can be enjoyed by anyone, but families with young children in general watch these programmings over higher MPAA rated content.  


<h2>Potential data points</h2>
Some areas of interest: 
* Overall most popular types/genres
* Any overlapp between the apps
* Comparing movie/tv shows geared toward all audiences to all other media, ie  are there more diverse cast/crew compared to more mature rated programming?
* Any outliers and what potential story do they tell

<h2>Any concerns about the data</h2>
I would like to find data based on time when shows are most watched or utilized by the most viewers.  After inital analysis, I want to focus on pandemic year information (2020 and 2021) to see how statisitics on changed for periods of lockdown.  

<h2>Identify if source is primary or secondary</h2>
All of my current datasets will be used as a primary source.  I am still on the look out for secondary sources that will address time when these shows are most viewed or time of year where some shows are more popular than other times. I also will look for sources that show data specfically for 2020 adn 2021.

<h2>If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source?</h2>
I want to use secondary data to do pandemic specific analysis.
