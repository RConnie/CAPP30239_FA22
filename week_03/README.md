<h>Description of data</h1>



<h>Why you are interested in this topic </h1>
Looking at viewing patterns of family (G/E rated) media from top streaming apps (Netflix, Hulu,)

Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data
See emerging patterns based on plateform time, year

Potential data points
Some areas of interest: 
* Overall top program, type, and genre
* Any overlapp between the apps
* Do movie/tv shows geared toward all audiences have a more diverse cast/crew compared to more mature rated programming
* Any outliers

Any concerns about the data
I would like to find data based on time when shows are most watched or utilized by the most viewers.  Also want to find any supplimental data on region.

Identify if source is primary or secondary
All of my current datasets will be used as a primary source.  I am still on the look out for secondary sources 

If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source?
