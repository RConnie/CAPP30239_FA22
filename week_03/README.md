<h1>Description of data</h1>



<h1>Why you are interested in this topic </h1>
Looking at viewing patterns of family (G/E rated) media from top streaming apps (Netflix, Hulu,)

Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data
See emerging patterns based on plateform time, year

<h1>Potential data points</h1>
Some areas of interest: 
* Overall top program, type, and genre
* Any overlapp between the apps
* Do movie/tv shows geared toward all audiences have a more diverse cast/crew compared to more mature rated programming
* Any outliers

<h1>Any concerns about the data</h1>
I would like to find data based on time when shows are most watched or utilized by the most viewers.  Also want to find any supplimental data on region.

<h1>Identify if source is primary or secondary</h1>
All of my current datasets will be used as a primary source.  I am still on the look out for secondary sources 

<h1>If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source?</h1>
