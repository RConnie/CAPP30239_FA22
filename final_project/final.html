    <h1>Screen Time: Family Media During the Pandemic</h1>
      <p>Generation Alpha is defined by young people born from 2010 to present.  
      They will spend their entire childhood consuming on demand programming, 
      and will have access to more media than any other generation before them.  
      In the early 2000s mainstream streaming platforms made their debut and in 
      2022 many families with kids under 12 entered a year of lockdown with options 
      of engagement limited to what was found inside of their homes.  
      </p>

      <p>During the start of the global COVID pandemic many turned to screen time for 
        comfort and entertainment and to cope with the lockdown.  Due to loss of childcare, 
        in-person school, and caregivers working from home, many families had to turn to 
        online entertainment; particularly those with young children, screen time became a 
        lifesaver.  All societal outcry about too much screen time diminished.  
      </p>

      <p>With screen time limitations suspended, what did streaming platforms offer in the way of 
        family friendly media,  what were families watching, and do streaming trends reflect what 
        young people are choosing to watch or trend more toward caregivers' preferences?
      </p>
      <p>For this analysis I looked at four major streaming platforms available in the US: 
        Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, and Amazon Prime Video. They collectively house over 10,000 
        family media options.  For this project I define family media as any media with a US 
        Parental Guidance Rating of:
        Y - appropriate for children of all ages, Y7 -suitable for children 7 and older, 
        G - appropriate for people of all ages, and PG - Parental guidance suggested.
      </p>

      <p>This analysis hopes to shed some insight into what media is available to Gen Alpha 
        families and what are some consumption trends.

    <h2>Streaming Platforms Breakdown by Parental Guidelines</h2>
    <p>The following ring charts display the percentage of family media compared to adult media 
      per platform. Family media is defined as all programming rated PG and under. Adult media 
      is rated PG-13 and higher.</p>

    <div id="chart" class="ring"></div>
    <p>Streaming services are a multi billion dollar industry so it makes sense that they market toward 
      those that can pay the bills, specifically they target media that adults want to access more so 
      than what young people want, unless it is a company that has become synonymous with family 
      entertainment.</p>

    <p>Unsurprisingly Disney + has the highest percentage of family friendly offerings compared to adult media.  
      Launched at the end of 2019 right before lockdown, Disney + primarily offered family centered media and 
      did not offer more mature content until March 2022. Disney is a household name and has clear branding that 
      it wants to be seen as a family friendly media conglomerate. </p>

    <h2>USA Top Family Genres by Platform</h2>
    <p>Family media broken down by genre and streaming platform.
      Number of media per genre by 100 (ex: 4.5 = 450 programs)
    </p>
    <div id="legend"></div>
    <p> </p>
  
    <div id="group"></div>

    <p>Comparing all 4 platforms top family genres, the most popular are: Comedy, Drama, 
      Sci-fi/Fantasy, Action/Adventure, Horror/Suspense, Documentary, Romance, International, 
      and Animation. Many of these genres had crossover and so the dominant genre was selected 
      for analysis (ie Animation could be a comedy but was classified as Animation vs a live action 
      comedy which was classified as Comedy).
    </p>
  
    <p>Most media sources throw children's media into large classifications that say more about the 
      type of media than the content found within, like the genre of animation.  This is dissimilar 
      to how adult media is classified with niche and sub categories such as Romantic Comedies or 
      Live Action Fantasy.  As such, when breaking down what types of programs are available across 
      streaming platforms for children can be a little vague on what exactly families are watching.</p>

    <h2>Representation in Disney 2020 Top Programs</h2>   
    <p>Since Disney is a household name that people associate with being family friendly, did the top shows streamed 
      reflect the diverse generation of youth who are watching it? </p>     

    <p>The 20 top Disney + programs streamed in 2020 broken down by demographics (race and gender representation)
       of lead character(s).</p>
    <div id="lolipop" class="loli"></div>
 
    <p>Programming was broken down by the lead character's or ensemble's race and gender (based on characters' pronouns).
        Characters that were animals or muppets were classified as having no race. 
    </p>

    <p>Some notes on this analysis, the top shows reflect what was streamed the most, and these demographics do 
      not necessarily reflect the diversity of media actually available on the platform.  For example, they could 
      have quite a few programs that have Latine or trans lead characters, it's just those shows did not make it 
      into the top 20 most streamed.</p>

    <p>This could lead some believe, that family media selection does not soley fall on the young person choosing. This 
      top 20 included programming from the Star Wars franchise and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This could hint at the 
      fact that when choosing youth media, multiple family members may have a say in what to watch, which would support the 
      demographic findings of lead characters.

  <h2>Netflix Top Family Programs from 2020-2022</h2>
  
    <p>Netflix is one of the most well known names in streaming platforms and they document
      their daily top ten programs.  Below are the top 50 family programs that made the daily 
      top 10 and how many days the were on the list.
    </p>

    <h3>Top programs broken down by Parental Guidance Ratings*
    </h3>
    
    <p>Hover over circles to see program title and how many days it was in the top 10.</p>
    <div id="cluster"></div>

    <h5> *Does not include Cocomelon to preserve aspect ratio, as it was an outlier
      that was on the top 10 for 428 days, the next ranked show was iCarly at 42 days.</h5>

      <p>Netflix can be synonymous to streaming platforms as they were one of the first services available
        and they have the most subscribers.  Netflix releases daily top 10 programming. So what programs did 
        families flock to at the beginning of the pandemic until 2022? </p>

      <p>On Netflix it appears that family nostalgia shows, holiday programs, and animated movies 
        reign supreme as the categories breaking the daily top ten. Older sitcoms from the 90s-00s and sitcom 
        reboots, Christmas movies, and quirky animated films dominated the top ten for weeks again suggesting
        that media selection is a family process; these trends reflect not only kids watching these programs, but 
        the influence of their caregivers who grew up watching the originals re-watching them as well.</p>  

    <h3>CoComelon's Reign</h3>
        <p>Representation of all 50 programs including CoComelon. Hover over to see program title, genre, and how many 
        days it was in the top 10.</p>

      <div id="cluster2"></div>

        <p>To no one's suprise, who hangs around toddlers, the big outlier is the program CoComelon; 
        a program broken into short segments of songs and nursery rhymes geared toward kids 5 and under.  Clocking in at 
        428 days in the top 10, CoComelon's popularity could stem from a variety of reasons that are not obvious from just 
        this analysis. It could coincide with the fact that the combination of caregivers working from home with a non school 
        age child, drove the need to find ways to occupy the youngest kids so that other tasks could be done.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>There are a  lot of options for families when it comes to selecting media to watch together or media families feel 
      ok about youth watching on their own. Trends suggest that not only are children selecting shows they like and families
      supporting them but also that media selection is a family affiar. Hopefully this analysis is helpful in lessening the 
      doom scrolling of trying to figure out what app to open or what type of family friendly media is available. The media 
      on demand generation has a lot of options and luckily it appears the top streaming platforms have a diversity of options 
      families can choose together.</p>

    <h1>Project Process </h1>
    <p>I am interested in this topic because as the parent of a child who was 2 when the pandemic started and who is now 5, 
      I was at a loss of how to balance it all while maintaining some sanity. I wasn't opposed to screen time but in moderation 
      and all my limits went out the window during lockdown.  As my family embraced being inside I found it difficult to figure 
      out what I wanted my family to watch.  If we were going to consume more media, I at least wanted it to not be detrimental 
      to us and I wanted to figure out what the best streaming platform with the most options for our budget.
    </p>

    <p>The primary datasets were collected from Kaggle user Shivam Bansal and I found supplementary data from websites linked above 
      and created my own datasets based on research. For example, after finding the top 20 Disney + shows, I sourced the lead 
      gender/race/genre from <a href="https://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>.</p>

    <p>At first I only wanted to focus on 2020 the year the pandemic officially started and most were confined to inside their homes.  
      It was apparent it would be difficult to get that specific data without web-scraping so I focused on a more general analysis of 
      the 4 platforms with some specific 2020-2022 analysis of Disney + and Netflix. </p>

      <p>The other data I wanted to find was data that directly reflected what kids are choosing for themselves, particularly data from 
        Youtube since it is more user interactive.  I just did not have the time to clean and analyze the 
        <a href="https://github.com/RConnie/CAPP30239_FA22/blob/main/week_03/Datasets/most_subscribed_youtube_channels.csv">YouTube data</a> I did find.</p>

      <p>For my charts I made some subjective choices in the analysis part. For the Disney character demographics I use gener and sex 
        interchangable (even though they are distinctly different) and made the decision if a character was 'male' or 'female' by the 
        pronouns the character was given. Another subjective choice was the genre classifications, if a program had multiple genres attached 
        to it, I made the choice of which genre to select as its main classification.</p>

      <p>My target audience is families with kids under 12. For my chart aesthetics I wanted charts that were simple, colorful, used organic 
        shapes, and were easy to read or understand to a certain extent if you could not read.  With more time I would have added more images to make 
        them even more kid friendly.</p>

      <p>The longest tasks of this project was cleaning data and figuring out the categories to use for analysis.  Every time I cleaned a set and 
        then did a draft of a chart, if I didn't like it I would have to go back and reclean the data and select a new chart type.</p>
      
      <p>I enjoyed the process and like the final look of the project.  Would definitely like to further the analysis at a later date to gather data 
        on what kids are choosing to watch beyond traditional mainstream media.</p>
