    <!-- <h1>Generation Alpha Streaming Habits</h1> -->
    <h1>Screen Time: Family Media During the Pandemic</h1>
    <p>Generation Aplpha is defined by young people born from 2010 to present.  They 
      are a generation that has access to more media options than any other generation
      before them.  In 2020, at the start of the COVID pandemic, many families with kids under 12
      entered a year of lockdown with options of engagement limited to what
      was found inside of people's homes.  
    </p>
      <p>This data project analyzes what media is available to families of young
      children on the top US streaming apps (Netflix, Disney +, Hulu, and Amazon Prime) 
      and takes a look at media consumed during the pandemic.  This analysis hopes to shed some 
      insight into what media is available to Gen Alpha families and what are some
      consumption trends.
