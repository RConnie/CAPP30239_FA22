    <!-- <h1>Generation Alpha Streaming Habits</h1> -->
    <h1>Screen Time: Family Media During the Pandemic</h1>
      <p>Generation Alpha is defined by young people born from 2010 to present.  
      They will spend their entire childhood consuming on demand programming, 
      and will have access to more media than any other generation before them.  
      In the early 2000s mainstream streaming platforms made their debut and in 
      2022 many families with kids under 12 entered a year of lockdown with options 
      of engagement limited to what was found inside of their homes.  
      </p>

      <p>During the start of the global COVID pandemic many turned to screen time for 
        comfort and entertainment and to cope with the lockdown.  Due to loss of childcare, 
        in-person school, and caregivers working from home, many families had to turn to 
        online entertainment; particularly those with young children screen time became a 
        lifesaver.  All societal outcry about too much screen time diminished.  
      </p>

      <p>With screen time limitations suspended, what did streaming platforms offer in the 
      way of family friendly media,  what were families watching, and were there any benefits 
      beyond sanity keeping in what was being consumed?
      </p>
      <p>For this analysis I looked at four major streaming platforms available in the US: 
        Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, and Amazon Prime Video. They collectively house over 10,000 
        family media options.  For this project I define family media as any media with a US 
        Parental Guidance Rating of:
        Y - appropriate for children of all ages, Y7 -suitable for children 7 and older, 
        G - appropriate for people of all ages, and PG - Parental guidance suggested.
      </p>

      <p>This analysis hopes to shed some insight into what media is available to Gen Alpha 
        families and what are some consumption trends.

    <div id="chart" class="ring"></div>
    <p>Unsurprisingly Disney + has the highest percentage of family friendly offerings compared 
      to adult media.  Launched at the end of 2019 right before lockdown, Disney + primarily offered 
      family centered media and did not offer more mature content until March 2022. Disney is a household 
      name and has clear branding that is seen as a family friendly media conglomerate. Somewhat 
      unexpectant was the finding that Amazon Prime Video had the largest family library at about 2,764 
      titles, surpassing Netflix, Disney, and Hulu.  Amazon also appeared to have the best distribution 
      of different family genres when accounting for the most popular youth genres.</p>

    <h2>USA Top Family Genres by Platform</h2>

    </p>
    <div id="legend"></div>

    <div id="group"></div>

    <p>Comparing all 4 platforms top family genres, the most popular are: Comedy, Drama, 
      Sci-fi/Fantasy, Action/Adventure, Horror/Suspense, Documentary, Romance, International, 
      and Animation. Many of these genres had crossover and so the dominant genre was selected 
      for analysis (ie Animation could be a comedy but was classified as Animation vs a live action 
      comedy which was classified as Comedy).
    </p>
  
    <p>The category of Horror/Suspense was the genre that was consistently low on all platforms, 
      but in general it appears that each platform had at least one genre that stood out from the 
      rest. For example if your family loves animation Disney + would give you the most choices, 
      while Netflix has a good selection of drama, Hulu's most populous family friendly genre is 
      comedy, and while Amazon had the biggest family library, it had the smallest number of media 
      available within the top genre categories, but did have an even distribution of a lot of the 
      genres. </p>

    <h2>Representation in Disney 2020 Top Programs</h2>   
    <p>Since Disney is a household name that people associate with being family friendly, I looked 
      at the top 20 Disney programs for 2020.  Did the top shows watched on Disney reflect the diverse 
      generation of youth who were watching it? </p>     

    <p>The 20 top Disney + programs streamed in 2020 broken down by demographics (race and gender representation)
       of lead character(s).</p>
    <div id="lolipop" class="loli"></div>
 
    <p>Limiting the analysis to lead characters' race and gender (based on characters' pronouns), it appears that 
      lead characters were still majority male, but the other demographics appear to have somewhat of an equal 
      showing comparable to population demographics.  Interestingly, many of the top show characters were non-human 
      thus excluding race and had ensemble casts that were equal in gender representation (multiple genders).</p>

    <p>Some notes on this analysis, top shows reflect what was streamed the most, and these shows demographics do 
      not necessarily reflect the diversity of media actually  available on the platform.  For example they could 
      have quite a few programs that have Latine or trans lead characters, it's just those shows did not make it 
      into the top 20 most streamed.</p>

    <p> Charts were created using data from 
      <a href="https://whatsondisneyplus.com/the-most-popular-series-on-disney-in-2020/">What's on Disney +</a>

  <h2>Netflix Top Family Programs from 2020-2022</h2>
  
    <p>Netflix is one of the most well known names in streaming platforms and they document
      their daily top ten programs.  Below are the top 50 family programs that made the daily 
      top 10 and how many days the were on the list.
    </p>

    <h3>Top programs broken down by Parental Guidance Ratings* 
    </h3>
    
    <div id="cluster"></div>

    <h5> *Does not include Cocomelon to preserve aspect ration, as it was an outlier
      that was on the top 10 for 428 days, the next ranked show was iCarly at 42 days.</h5>

      <p>Netflix can be synonymous to streaming platforms as they were one of the first the public 
        became aware of and they have the most subscribers.  Netflix also released daily top 10 
        programming. So what programs did families flock to at the beginning of the pandemic until 
        2022?  On Netflix it appears that family nostalgia shows, holiday programs, and animated movies 
        reign supreme as the genres breaking the daily top ten. Older sitcoms from the 90s-00s and sitcom 
        reboots, Christmas movies, and quirky animated films dominated the top ten for weeks.  </p>

        <p>These could reflect not only kids watching these programs, but the influence of their caregivers 
          who grew up watching the originals re-watching them as well.</p>

      <div id="cluster2"></div>

        <p>The big outlier is obviously the toddler focused program Cocomelon, a program broken into short segments 
        of songs and nursery rhymes.  Clocking in at 4 days in the top 10, Cocomelon's popularity could stem from 
        a variety of reasons that are not obvious from just this analysis, but could coincide with the fact that 
        the combination of caregivers working from home with a child under 5 drove the need to find ways to occupy 
        the youngest kids so that other tasks could be done.</p>

    <p>There are a  lot of options for families when it comes to selecting media to watch together or media families feel 
      ok about youth watching on their own. Hopefully this analysis is helpful in lessening the doom scrolling of trying 
      to figure out what app to open or what type of family friendly media is available. The media on demand generation has 
      a lot of options and luckily it appears the top streaming platforms have a diversity of options families can choose.</p>

    <h1>Project Process </h1>
    <p>I am interested in this topic because as the parent of a child who was 2 when the pandemic started and who is now 5, 
      I was at a loss of how to balance it all while maintaining some sanity. I wasn't opposed to screen time but in moderation 
      and all my limits when out the window during lockdown.  As my family embraced being inside I found it difficult to figure 
      out what I wanted my family to watch.  If we were going to consume more media, I at least wanted it to not be detrimental 
      to us and I wanted to figure out what the best streaming platform with the most options for our budget.
    </p>

    <p>The primary datasets were collected from Kaggle user Shivam Bansal and I found supplementary data from websites linked above 
      and created my own datasets based on research. For example, after finding the top 20 Disney + shows, I sourced the lead 
      gender/race/genre from <a href="https://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>.</p>

    <p>At first I only wanted to focus on 2020 the year the pandemic officially started and most were confined to inside their homes.  
      It was apparent it would be difficult to get that specific data without web-scraping so I focused on a more general analysis of 
      the 4 platforms with some specific 2020-2022 analysis of Disney + and Netflix. </p>

      <p>The other data I wanted to find was data that directly reflected what kids are choosing for themselves, particularly data from 
        Youtube since it is more user interactive.  I just did not have the time to clean and analyze the 
        <a href="https://github.com/RConnie/CAPP30239_FA22/blob/main/week_03/Datasets/most_subscribed_youtube_channels.csv">YouTube data</a> I did find.</p>

      <p>For my charts I made some subjective choices in the analysis part. For the Disney character demographics I use gener and sex 
        interchangable (even though they are disctictly different) and made the decision if a character was 'male' or 'female' by the 
        pronouns the character was given. Another subject choice was the genre classifications, if a program had multiple genres attached 
        to it, I made the choice of which genre to select as its main classification.</p>

      <p>My target audience is families with kids under 12. For my chart aesthetics I wanted charts that were simple, colorful, used organic 
        shapes, and were easy to read or understand to a certain extent if you could not read.  If time I would have added more images to make 
        them even more kid friendly.</p>

      <p>The longest tasks of this project was cleaning data and figuring out the categories to use for analysis.  Every time I cleaned a set and 
        then did a draft of a chart, if I didn't like it I would have to go back and reclean the data and select a new chart type.</p>
      
      <p>I enjoyed the process and like the final look of the project.  Would definitely like to further the analysis at a later date to gather data 
        on what kids are choosing to watch beyond traditional mainstream media.</p>
