    <h1>Generation Alpha Streaming Habits</h1>
    <p>Generation Aplpha is defined by young people born from 2010 to present.  They 
      are a generation that has access to more media options than any other generation
      before them.  In 2020, at the start of the COVID pandemic, many families with Alpha 
      Generation kids entered a year of lockdown with options of engagement limited to what
      was found inside of people's homes.  
    </p>
      <p>This data project analyzes what media is available to families of young
      children on the top streaming apps (Netflix, Disney +, Hulu, and Amazon Prime) in the 
      United States and takes a look at media consumed in 2020.  This analysis hopes to
      shed some insight into what media is available to Gen Alpha families and what are some
      consumption trends.
