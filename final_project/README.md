<h2>Alpha Gen Media</h2> 

<p>Families everywhere are turning to streaming platforms for their entertainment.  Generation Alpha (born 2010 -present) will spend their entire childhood consuming on demand programming, and will have access to more media than any other generation before them.  With so many choices and only internet speed as a limitation, what media are families devouring?</p>

<p>Netflix, Disney +, Amazon Prime, and Hulu are four major streaming platforms that collectively house over 10,000 family media options.  With a majority of US households subscribing to a streaming service, it is likely they also have access to at least one of these platforms.  So what is the landscape of media produced for children* and their families?  My final project Alpha Gen Media will attempt to shed light on the state of family streaming options. </p>

<p>Are there any benefits of watching children’s media?  Is programming more diverse?  Are newer shows more engaging than older programs?  What countries  are the top producers of family media and do popular genres differ across continents?  One thing for sure is that family media can be enjoyed at any age, so what will your household choose?</p>

*This project defines children’s media as any media with a US certificate rating of PG and below.  PG is considered appropriate content for those 12 years and younger.
