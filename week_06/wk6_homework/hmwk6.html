        <h1>Mental Illness and Deadly Police Encounters</h1>
        <p> The following analysis uses police shooting data that looks at the number of 
        individuals harmed by police who had a known mental illness.  This analysis 
        hopes to further the discussion around mental illness and safety, particularly 
        to expand the narrative that mentally ill individuals have an increased risk of 
        being harmed by police.</p>

            <h2>Mental Illness Deaths by State</h2>
            <p>
            This chart examines each state that reported police shootings in 2015 and looked 
            at what percentage of those incidents involved a mentally ill person.  This bar 
            chart is skewed, as it does not give the entire picture of impact.  Percentages 
            could be high due to the fact that there were not many total shootings (ex: ME only 
            had 4 incidents total, 2 of which were with mentally ill individuals).  With an estimate 
            \of nearly 20% of Americans having a mental illness, this chart still shows an impact that 
            disabled individuals may not receive the support they need if they are disproportionately 
            involved in police encounters.
