        <h1>Mental Illness and Deadly Police Encounters</h1>
        <p> The following analysis uses police shooting data that looks at the number of 
        individuals harmed by police who had a known mental illness.  This analysis 
        hopes to further the discussion around mental illness and safety, particularly 
        to expand the narrative that mentally ill individuals have an increased risk of 
        being harmed by police.</p>

        <h2>Mental Illness Deaths by State</h2>
            <p>
            This chart examines each state that reported police shootings in 2015 and looked 
            at what percentage of those incidents involved a mentally ill person.  This bar 
            chart is skewed, as it does not give the entire picture of impact.  Percentages 
            could be high due to the fact that there were not many total shootings (ex: ME only 
            had 4 incidents total, 2 of which were with mentally ill individuals).  With an estimate 
            of nearly 20% of Americans having a mental illness, this chart still shows an impact that 
            disabled individuals may not receive the support they need if they are disproportionately 
            involved in police encounters.</p>

            <p>If more time, I would work on the style of this chart to make it less dense, easier to read,
            would try different color schemes, and have interaction with more information available about
            each state as the moue tracks over a bar.

        <h2>Mental Illness Deaths by Race</h2>
        <p>
            This series of ring charts divides police shootings by race and then looks at the number 
            of shootings within each racial category that were of mentally ill individuals.  It is 
            interesting to look at intersectional identities to see if a pattern or outlier emerges.

           It would be interesting to investigate the incidents that had an unknown race since the 
            total number of 146 shootings and had one of the biggest percentages of mentally ill 
            individuals harmed.</p>

        <p> If more time, I would fix the size of the rings and make the text more legible. I would 
                also use a uniform color scheme so the rings match the other 2 charts.</p>

        <h2>Comparing Mental Illness Deaths by State</h2>
        <p>
        Texas, Florida, and California had the highest police shootings in 2015 and this multi-line 
        graph compares the number of deaths they respectively had per month. The graph allows for the 
        audience to see which month if any had peaks and can see if there are any patterns or outliers
        It would be insightful to have a multi-line graph of comparing each state against data from. 
        another year to see how their police interactions with mentally ill individuals has changed.</p>
            
        <p>If more time, I would fix the x-axis to make the months more legible.</p>
