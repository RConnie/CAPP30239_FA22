Add an intro paragraph about you. Include your degree path.
I'm Rebecca Connie and a 2nd year MSCAPP student.  Professionally I've worked in education
and community organizing for the past 10 years and am pivoting to a career in data science
that focuses on empowering communities.  I'm a 5th generation Chicagoan and the quickest way 
to my heart is to share a jibarito with me.
